Description: Hash table with one pass.
             we use a dictionary  key value, where
             key is the number from array nums, and
             value is a list of indexes.

    Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

    You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

    Example:
    Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

    Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
    return [0, 1].
